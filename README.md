### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jahirul Islam. Currently working on large scale logs processing @aws

I am mostly a back-end developer and I have experience of working with a host of languages and technologies. I enjoy some occasional front-end development as well!

I like solving problems and working with new technologies.
